Background of the study

   An information system is like a living network made up of several key parts that work hand in hand to keep things running smoothly. Hardware covers all the physical tools computers, servers, and networking gear that make it possible to process and store data. Software is the brain of the system, made up of programs and apps that let people use, manage, and analyze information. At the heart of it all is data the raw facts and figures that, when processed, become meaningful insights. Then there are the people, from IT experts who design and maintain the system to managers and everyday users who rely on it to get their jobs done. Finally, processes act as the system's playbook, outlining the proper steps and standards to make sure everything runs accurately, securely, and efficiently.

   Information systems come in different forms depending on what they're meant to do. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) handle everyday business activities like recording sales or tracking inventory. Management Information Systems (MIS) provide organized reports that help managers make smarter decisions. Decision Support Systems (DSS) dig deeper, using data analysis and models to guide complex choices. And Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems tie all parts of a business together finance, HR, sales, and more into one unified platform that helps everything flow seamlessly.

   The Little Flower High School (LFHS) has stood as a beacon of faith and learning in Peñarrubia, Abra since its founding in 1961. Born from the vision of Reverend Father Carlos Puetz, S.V.D., then the parish priest of St. Therese of the Child Jesus Parish, the school was established under the Diocese of Bangued with one heartfelt mission to bring quality Catholic education closer to the youth of Peñarrubia and neighboring barangays who had little access to high schools in Bangued. Father Puetz dreamed of a place where students could grow not only in knowledge but also in faith, character, and compassion. The name "Little Flower" was chosen in honor of St. Therese of the Child Jesus, the parish's patron saint, whose "Little Way" of simplicity, humility, and love continues to guide the school's spirit to this day.

   When LFHS first opened its doors, only forty-six young students filled its classrooms a modest beginning that would blossom over time. With the unwavering support of the parish and the local community, the school slowly grew, adding more grade levels, improving its facilities, and nurturing a generation of learners who carried both wisdom and values into the world. Through the years, LFHS remained deeply rooted in its Catholic identity, weaving faith and moral formation into every lesson, activity, and milestone.

   Today, Little Flower High School stands as a proud testament to Father Puetz's dream. Recognized by the Department of Education and included in the Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) program, the school continues to thrive. It has embraced educational reforms like the K-12 program and now offers Senior High School strands such as HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences), ensuring students are well-prepared for college and beyond. More than six decades later, LFHS remains a place where young minds are shaped, hearts are guided, and faith is kept alive a living legacy of love, learning, and service to the people of Peñarrubia.

   Little Flower High School (LFHS) continues to grow as a haven for learners from Grades 7 to 12, offering a complete secondary education founded on academic excellence, discipline, and faith. The school takes pride in its facilities that create a balanced environment for both learning and personal development.

   The computer room provides students with access to modern technology, helping them build essential digital skills in an increasingly connected world. The canteen offers a friendly space where students can relax, share meals, and enjoy healthy, affordable food options during their breaks. For the safety and well-being of everyone on campus, the school clinic stands ready to provide first aid and basic medical care. Clean and accessible comfort rooms (CRs) are also maintained throughout the school to ensure the comfort of both students and staff.

   To accommodate students who live farther from the campus, LFHS offers a dormitory that provides a safe and nurturing home away from home a place where friendships are built and values are strengthened. The Audio-Visual Room is equipped with multimedia tools that make classes more engaging and interactive, while the Achievements Room proudly displays the trophies, medals, and certificates that symbolize the hard work, talent, and victories of the Little Flower community through the years.

   Together, these facilities reflect LFHS's commitment to holistic education shaping students not just intellectually, but also emotionally, socially, and spiritually. Every corner of the campus tells a story of growth, faith, and excellence proof that Little Flower High School remains a true garden where young minds blossom.

   The vision of the Little Flower High School of Peñarrubia is to be an agent of the Diocese of Bangued in its educational apostolate for the integral formation of the young people of Abra who are mature Christians and enlightened and empowered, model citizens. Its vision will make the progress of the Theresians as they continue to grow in faith, wisdom, and service.

   In line with this, the mission of the Little Flower High School of Peñarrubia is to educate and influence the young people of Abra to become mature Christians who have trust and faith in God, love and concern for others, and the spirit of service for the Church.

Statement of the Problem

   The Little Flower High School of Peñarrubia (LFHS) currently relies on manual methods for tracking school events, activities, and daily operations. This traditional approach presents several challenges, including data inaccuracies, inefficiency, and difficulty in accessing important records. Without an automated system, managing and retrieving information related to school announcements, student participation, and administrative tasks becomes time-consuming and prone to human error. The reliance on physical documents and bulletin boards limits the school's ability to provide timely updates to students, parents, and staff, leading to communication gaps and missed opportunities for engagement.

   Moreover, the absence of a centralized digital platform makes it difficult for the school to maintain organized records, monitor event participation, and ensure that important information reaches all stakeholders. The existing manual system does not support online admission applications, making the enrollment process more cumbersome for prospective students and their families. Additionally, there is no efficient way to collect, manage, and respond to feedback from students, parents, and visitors, which hinders the school's ability to improve its services and address concerns promptly. Furthermore, the school lacks a systematic approach to gathering and showcasing student testimonials and success stories, which could inspire prospective students and strengthen the school community. There is also no mechanism for students to actively engage with school content through reactions and comments, limiting their sense of connection and participation in school activities.

   This study seeks to address the following questions:

   1. How can the School Information Management System centralize and organize school information to improve accessibility and reduce reliance on manual record-keeping?

   2. In what ways can the system enhance communication between administrators, teachers, students, and parents through features such as announcements, notifications, and a feedback system?

   3. How can an online admission application feature streamline the enrollment process and make it more convenient for prospective students and their families?

   4. What role-based access controls and features are necessary to ensure that public viewers, students, teachers, and administrators can effectively interact with the system based on their respective needs and responsibilities?

   5. How can a testimonials system enable students, alumni, and visitors to share their experiences while maintaining quality control through administrative approval workflows?

   6. What interactive features (reactions, comments) can be implemented to increase student engagement with school content while ensuring appropriate moderation and oversight?

   7. How can a personalized student dashboard provide quick access to relevant information such as schedules, announcements, and personal testimonial submissions?


Objectives of the Study

   The main goal of this study is to develop and implement a comprehensive Laravel-based School Information Management System (SIMS) for Little Flower High School of Peñarrubia that centralizes school information, enhances communication between stakeholders, streamlines administrative processes, and promotes student engagement through a secure, role-based web platform with four distinct user levels: Public Viewers, Students, Teachers, and Administrators.

   Tailwind CSS. A utility-first CSS framework version 3.x used for styling the entire application through composition of utility classes (e.g., bg-blue-500, text-white, p-4, rounded-lg) rather than custom CSS, providing responsive design utilities with breakpoint prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:) for mobile-first development, custom color palette defined in tailwind.config.js including primary colors (primary-950, primary-900, primary-800 for dark gradients used in hero sections, primary-600, primary-500 for buttons and links), secondary colors for accents and highlights, and gray scale for text and backgrounds; component classes for reusable patterns like modern-card, hover-lift, and badge variants; JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler generating styles on-demand for minimal CSS file size; dark mode support through dark: prefix (not currently implemented but available); consistent spacing scale (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, etc.) ensuring visual harmony; and purging unused styles in production for optimal performance, enabling rapid development with consistent design while maintaining small file sizes.
