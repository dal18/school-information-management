                                   INTRODUCTION
Background of the study
   An information system is like a living network made up of several key parts that work hand in hand to keep things running smoothly. Hardware covers all the physical tools computers, servers, and networking gear that make it possible to process and store data. Software is the brain of the system, made up of programs and apps that let people use, manage, and analyze information. At the heart of it all is data the raw facts and figures that, when processed, become meaningful insights. Then there are the people, from IT experts who design and maintain the system to managers and everyday users who rely on it to get their jobs done. Finally, processes act as the system's playbook, outlining the proper steps and standards to make sure everything runs accurately, securely, and efficiently.
   Information systems come in different forms depending on what they're meant to do. Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) handle everyday business activities like recording sales or tracking inventory. Management Information Systems (MIS) provide organized reports that help managers make smarter decisions. Decision Support Systems (DSS) dig deeper, using data analysis and models to guide complex choices. And Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems tie all parts of a business together finance, HR, sales, and more into one unified platform that helps everything flow seamlessly.
   The Little Flower High School (LFHS) has stood as a beacon of faith and learning in Peñarrubia, Abra since its founding in 1961. Born from the vision of Reverend Father Carlos Puetz, S.V.D., then the parish priest of St. Therese of the Child Jesus Parish, the school was established under the Diocese of Bangued with one heartfelt mission to bring quality Catholic education closer to the youth of Peñarrubia and neighboring barangays who had little access to high schools in Bangued. Father Puetz dreamed of a place where students could grow not only in knowledge but also in faith, character, and compassion. The name "Little Flower" was chosen in honor of St. Therese of the Child Jesus, the parish's patron saint, whose "Little Way" of simplicity, humility, and love continues to guide the school's spirit to this day.
   When LFHS first opened its doors, only forty-six young students filled its classrooms a modest beginning that would blossom over time. With the unwavering support of the parish and the local community, the school slowly grew, adding more grade levels, improving its facilities, and nurturing a generation of learners who carried both wisdom and values into the world. Through the years, LFHS remained deeply rooted in its Catholic identity, weaving faith and moral formation into every lesson, activity, and milestone.
   Today, Little Flower High School stands as a proud testament to Father Puetz's dream. Recognized by the Department of Education and included in the Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC) program, the school continues to thrive. It has embraced educational reforms like the K-12 program and now offers Senior High School strands such as HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences), ensuring students are well-prepared for college and beyond. More than six decades later, LFHS remains a place where young minds are shaped, hearts are guided, and faith is kept alive a living legacy of love, learning, and service to the people of Peñarrubia.
   Little Flower High School (LFHS) continues to grow as a haven for learners from Grades 7 to 12, offering a complete secondary education founded on academic excellence, discipline, and faith. The school takes pride in its facilities that create a balanced environment for both learning and personal development. At the heart of the campus lies the school library, a quiet sanctuary filled with books and learning materials that nurture curiosity and a lifelong love for reading. The faculty room serves as the workspace of dedicated teachers who guide, mentor, and inspire their students every day.
   The computer room provides students with access to modern technology, helping them build essential digital skills in an increasingly connected world. The canteen offers a friendly space where students can relax, share meals, and enjoy healthy, affordable food options during their breaks. For the safety and well-being of everyone on campus, the school clinic stands ready to provide first aid and basic medical care. Clean and accessible comfort rooms (CRs) are also maintained throughout the school to ensure the comfort of both students and staff.
   To accommodate students who live farther from the campus, LFHS offers a dormitory that provides a safe and nurturing home away from home a place where friendships are built and values are strengthened. The Audio-Visual Room is equipped with multimedia tools that make classes more engaging and interactive, while the Achievements Room proudly displays the trophies, medals, and certificates that symbolize the hard work, talent, and victories of the Little Flower community through the years.
   Together, these facilities reflect LFHS's commitment to holistic education shaping students not just intellectually, but also emotionally, socially, and spiritually. Every corner of the campus tells a story of growth, faith, and excellence proof that Little Flower High School remains a true garden where young minds blossom.
   The vision of the Little Flower High School of Peñarrubia is to be an agent of the Diocese of Bangued in its educational apostolate for the integral formation of the young people of Abra who are mature Christians and enlightened and empowered, model citizens. Its vision will make the progress of the Theresians as they continue to grow in faith, wisdom, and service.
   In line with this, the mission of the Little Flower High School of Peñarrubia is to educate and influence the young people of Abra to become mature Christians who have trust and faith in God, love and concern for others, and the spirit of service for the Church. It also aims to form enlightened, model citizens who are physically and mentally developed, socially and ecologically responsible, culture-oriented and economically self-reliant, as well as nationalistic and upright.

Statement of the Problem
   The Little Flower High School of Peñarrubia (LFHS) currently relies on manual methods for tracking school events, activities, and daily operations. This traditional approach presents several challenges, including data inaccuracies, inefficiency, and difficulty in accessing important records. Without an automated system, managing and retrieving information related to school announcements, student participation, and administrative tasks becomes time-consuming and prone to human error. The reliance on physical documents and bulletin boards limits the school's ability to provide timely updates to students, parents, and staff, leading to communication gaps and missed opportunities for engagement.
   Moreover, the absence of a centralized digital platform makes it difficult for the school to maintain organized records, monitor event participation, and ensure that important information reaches all stakeholders. The existing manual system does not support online admission applications, making the enrollment process more cumbersome for prospective students and their families. Additionally, there is no efficient way to collect, manage, and respond to feedback from students, parents, and visitors, which hinders the school's ability to improve its services and address concerns promptly.
   This study seeks to address the following questions:
   1. How can the School Information Management System centralize and organize school information to improve accessibility and reduce reliance on manual record-keeping?
   2. In what ways can the system enhance communication between administrators, teachers, students, and parents through features such as announcements, notifications, and a feedback system?
   3. How can an online admission application feature streamline the enrollment process and make it more convenient for prospective students and their families?
   4. What role-based access controls and features are necessary to ensure that public viewers, students, teachers, and administrators can effectively interact with the system based on their respective needs and responsibilities?
Objectives of the Study
   The main goal of this study is to develop and implement a comprehensive Laravel-based School Information Management System (SIMS) for Little Flower High School of Peñarrubia that centralizes school information, enhances communication between stakeholders, and streamlines administrative processes through a secure, role-based web platform with four distinct user levels: Public Viewers, Students, Teachers, and Administrators.
   Specifically, this study aims to:
   1. Develop a secure web-based platform using Laravel Framework with MySQL database that implements role-based access control for Public Viewers, Students, Teachers, and Administrators.
   2. Create a comprehensive information portal that allows public viewers to access school information including the mission, vision, facilities, class schedules, announcements, student stories, and activities through an intuitive interface.
   3. Implement an online admission application system with multi-step forms, file upload capabilities for documents (birth certificates, report cards, student photos), and automated email confirmation with tracking numbers.
   4. Design and deploy a personalized student dashboard that displays today's schedule, weekly schedules, recent announcements, blog posts, student stories, and system statistics (courses, announcements, activities, facilities counts).
   5. Build a content management system for teachers and administrators to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) announcements, courses, facilities, activities, student stories, blog posts, and class schedules with soft delete functionality.
   6. Establish comprehensive administrative controls including user management (account creation, role assignment, suspension), admission application processing (review, approval, rejection), comment moderation (approval/rejection workflow), and feedback management with response capabilities.
   7. Integrate interactive feedback and commenting system with IP tracking for guests and user-ID tracking for authenticated users, implementing a moderation workflow where comments require admin approval before becoming public.
   8. Develop a real-time notification system with bell icon badges, dropdown menus, and desktop notifications for announcements, schedule changes, event reminders, admin messages, and admission status updates.
   9. Create a global search functionality with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+K/Cmd+K) that searches across announcements, courses, facilities, activities, stories, and blog posts with autocomplete suggestions and result categorization.
   10. Implement a calendar system with monthly, weekly, and daily views that displays school events with color-coding and integrates class schedules showing teacher assignments and room information.
   11. Ensure full mobile responsiveness with adaptive layouts, touch-friendly interfaces, mobile navigation, optimized images, and mobile-optimized modals for accessibility across all devices.

   School Administration, the system provides comprehensive tools for managing all aspects of school operations through an admin dashboard with complete CRUD functionality for content management, user account management with role assignment capabilities, admission application processing with review and approval workflows, comment moderation systems, feedback management with response features, and detailed analytics and statistics. This centralized control panel enables administrators to efficiently oversee school information, monitor system activity, and maintain security while reducing the administrative burden of manual processes.
   Teachers, the system empowers them with content management capabilities to create and update announcements, manage course information, document school activities and facilities, publish student success stories and blog posts, maintain class schedules, and moderate student comments. These tools free teachers from administrative overhead, allowing them to focus more on instruction and student engagement while still maintaining effective communication channels with students and parents.
   Students, the system serves as an organized and reliable source of information through a personalized dashboard showing today's schedule, weekly schedules, and recent announcements. Students can access course catalogs filtered by grade level, view school facilities and activities, read and react to student stories and blog posts, receive real-time notifications about school events and changes, manage their profiles including updating personal information and profile pictures, and submit feedback directly to administration. This promotes better participation and enables students to stay informed and engaged with school activities.
   Parents and Guardians, the system enhances communication by providing easy access to school information, announcements, and events through the public portal. Parents can monitor school activities, view class schedules, access the school calendar, submit inquiries through the contact form, and apply for admission online with file upload capabilities and tracking numbers. This transparency strengthens the connection between home and school, fostering a more supportive learning community and enabling parents to stay actively involved in their child's education.
   Prospective Students and Families, the system provides comprehensive information about the school through an accessible public interface showcasing the school's mission, vision, history, facilities, courses, and achievements. The online admission application system with multi-step forms, document upload capabilities, and automated email confirmations makes the enrollment process more convenient and efficient, reducing barriers to entry and improving the applicant experience.
   IT Department and System Maintainers, the Laravel framework provides a robust, well-documented platform with built-in security features including authentication, authorization, and CSRF protection. The use of industry-standard technologies (PHP, MySQL, Blade Templates) ensures maintainability and the availability of technical support. The system's soft delete functionality preserves data integrity, while comprehensive logging and error handling facilitate troubleshooting and maintenance.
   Future Researchers and Developers, this study serves as a valuable reference for the development of other school-based Management Information Systems using Laravel framework. It demonstrates best practices for implementing role-based access control with four distinct user levels, integrating authentication and authorization systems, building content management systems with CRUD operations, implementing notification systems, creating responsive web interfaces, and managing file uploads and document processing. The documentation provides insights into how Laravel's features can be leveraged to streamline operations and promote efficiency in academic institutions.
